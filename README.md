FakeNews App-UX Desain

This read me contains the steps in the formation of UI/UX.

At the beginning is to make research designs based on the chosen theme according to the theme that has been determined by the team.
then create a user-flow for planning user activities on the application
after that we make a mockup based on the user-flow that has been made and then we make a low design for an overview of the application in the future
the mockup takes approximately 2 weeks
after the mockup is complete then the UI/UX team creates the main design to be developed into an application
the time for finishing the design takes 2 weeks then the design is given to the application backend for application development
And the final stage is making the system design sorted by categories such as buttons, categories et al.
